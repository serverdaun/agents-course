Now that you have all the details, let's get started! We're going to do four things:

1. **Create your Hugging Face Account** if it's not already done
2. **Sign up to Discord and introduce yourself** (don't be shy 🤗)
3. **Follow the Hugging Face Agents Course** on the Hub
4. **Spread the word** about the course

### Step 1: Create Your Hugging Face Account

When you join, remember to introduce yourself in `#introduce-yourself`.

We have multiple AI Agent-related channels:

If this is your first time using Discord, we wrote a Discord 101 to get the best practices. Check [the next section](discord101).
